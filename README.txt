ABOUT
==============

The zipped files "Bass_Strait_SWOT_calval_data.zip" and "Bass_Strait_SWOT_calval_software.zip" contain data and python jupyter notebooks supporting the research presented in Earth and Space Science publication "In Situ Geometric Validation of SWOT Satellite Observations in Bass Strait, Australia", Hay et al., 2025. The analysis is conducted with data from the Bass Strait altimetry validation facility during the SWOT fast sampling phase (FSP) from 2023-03-30 to 2023-07-10.  


NOTES
- All GNSS outputs are from the GipsyX processing software, except where 'TRACK' is specified.
